Noah Dubitzky Projects

This project was written in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, and node.js. The App folder contains the backend node.js code that sets up the http requests to the mysql database. The Public folder contains the html and javascript files for the site. The server.js file is what is run in the command prompt in order to run the server locally.  

The website allows for store owners to set up their store layouts and inventory online, so that shoppers can access them and shop conviniently at their stores. It also allows for shoppers to shop at a store by creating a shopping list using the inventory of the given store.
