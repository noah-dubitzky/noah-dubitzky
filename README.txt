Pixel Battle is a 2d hack and slash platformer game creating with the phaser.js game engine.
In order to run this application, the following files must be placed in a web server, such as LAMP, WAMP, or MAMP.
  -scripts
  -assets
  -backup_files
  -index.html
I have pre-recorded videos of the game play.
